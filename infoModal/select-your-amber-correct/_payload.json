It brings to mind positive energy, a good luck charm and a seaside souvenir.\nIt’s called the Gold of the Baltic and the Living Stone.\nIt was created by nature: it is a fossilised resin.\nBaltic amber’s scent is its unique feature. It smells like pine resin.\nAmber is light. You can charge amber so that it attracts lint.\nThe largest piece of Baltic amber found to date weighs almost 10kg. It is 47 cm in length.\nNatural pieces of amber come in different colours and shapes. No two pieces of natural amber are alike.\nThe way people have different skin colours, amber comes in different colours too. Colour the pieces in shades of yellow, orange, red and brown. You can also leave some white areas.\nThe colours and colour effects we see are the result of the changes that took place in the resin and of the conditions in which the amber rested underground for millions of years.\nBaltic amber does not always have the same colour through and through. You can often find exciting patterns of two or more colours and shades.",{"type":10,"children":11,"toc":39},"root",[12,19,24,29,34],{"type":13,"tag":14,"props":15,"children":16},"element","p",{},[17],{"type":18,"value":8},"text",{"type":13,"tag":14,"props":20,"children":21},{},[22],{"type":18,"value":23},"People have named and described over 100 colour varieties of Baltic amber!
